Arch Linux Updates Indicator DDE Dock Plugin
===============
Update indicator for Arch Linux and Deepin Dock, 

Depend on `pacman-contrib`


Other notes
-------
Not sure if it's a bug of Qt or not, but if I name qrc file `icons.qrc`, it will not be able to find the resource files. 
It will be appreciated if anyone can help me with why.
